          <p class="section-description">
            I created Creyt with the idea of making a difference in how we handle things we usually discard. It's all about reusing stuff rather than tossing it away or just recycling. I teamed up with Gothenburg City to contribute to their mission of creating a greener society and preserving our environment. The whole idea was to keep it simple and nice in design so that it suits everyone and is easy to use and understand.

            <p class="section-description">
              The development process involved extensive research, initial prototyping with greyboxes, rigorous testing for user feedback, and crafting the comprehensive stylesheet. This iterative approach ensured a well-rounded framework, covering all design frames and finalizing the prototype to meet the project's goals.

              After conducting extensive tests and iterating based on gathered feedback, as well as incorporating additional insights obtained from the product, the final iteration was deemed complete and satisfactory. Continuous refinement through user feedback ensured that the final product was not only finished but also met the necessary standards of quality and usability.
